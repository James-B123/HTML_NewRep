     <ul2>	
         <li>Weber (June 2017) – This was one week of work experience at a factory (3 days). I was working alongside a staff member, who set me tasks that mostly consisted of completing spreadsheets and creating mortar in the lab. This was my first ever experience in the world of work. It made me more confident with spreadsheets and data-handling using a computer.</li> 
            <li>British Heart Foundation (June 2018) – This was also one week (5 days). I was mostly tidying the store and assisting staff members. I liked it, and it was a fresh introduction to working in a shop.</li>
       <li>One Stop Weedon (July 1st – October 3rd 2019) – I completed a 3 month temporary contract at One Stop in Weedon. I really enjoyed working there and it has inspired me to continue working in retail. I was completing a range of tasks such as declaring money, working the till, loading stock onto shelves and tidying/cleaning the store.

    Sept 2017- June 2018, Northampton College
    </h3>
    OCR level 3 ICT introductory diploma one A-level equivalent achieved (completion June 2018, pass overall). This full-time course took me 1 year to complete. I passed the following units:  

    <ul class="two">
        <li>Unit 1 (Fundementals of IT)</li>
        <li>Unit 2 (Global Information)</li>
        <li>Unit 6 (Application Design)</li>
        <li>Unit 13 (Social Media and Digital Marketing</li>
        <li>Unit 17 (Internet of Everything)</li>
        <li>Unit 21 (Website Design and Prototyping)</li>
    </ul>
           <p>
               </p>
    My favourite unit in the first year of this course was unit 21 because I enjoyed implementing and altering the coding, as well as designing my own website for promoting an art gallery. I also liked the problem-solving aspect within it and figuring out the correct codes in order to make certain features function because it made the website designing challenging and it required logic to fix issues.
