Overall this module has been very challenging for me as I have never thoroughly completed a website using html and css before. My favourite part of this module where I experienced the least trouble was creating the CV Page. This is because the html and css used were nearly identical to the Home page's and only needed a little tweaking. My least favourite part of the module where I experienced the most trouble was when using GitHub. I had problems with setting it up as I wasn't able to commit from Visual Studio and getting the code to perform actions to GitHub was a fairly lengthy process. 
<p></p>
The Home page I created first. It displays the site purpose. The main goal from this page was to create a base html and css page which I could reuse and tweak when creating the other webpages. This page looks the easiest to make but I found it fairly hard as it was the first one I created and I had to use some of the video guides to workout how to code properly. The part of this page I enjoyed the most was designing the background because I found it easy to code and I liked all the different colour options I could use.
<p></p>
Next I created the Portfolio page. I used an image off the internet and repeated it 12 times in a 3x4 grid using css. The grid was definitely the trickiest part of designing this webpage because I was struggling to get the columns and rows to line up properly. 
<p></p>
Next was the Contact page. This page was possibly the hardest to make because the styling and positioning of the boxes were a lengthy process as many times the code I used wasn't working properly. I also had doubts about the amount of boxes I used because I now feel as if I only needed an email address and message. 
<p></p>
I then created the CV page. This was very easy as it required didn't require much altercation to both the html and css. I decided to use a couple of different headings for this page because I felt it looked more professional. 
<p></p>
Overall with the navigation features, I found the navigation bar for the PC version to be very easy to make and the hamburger icon on the mobile version to be very difficult to make. I found the navigation bar easy to make because I have previously designed one before on a college course and there were loads of basic tutorials online on how to do it. I found the hamburger icon very hard to make as I had never created one before and I had problems with it not displaying the navigation bar when I clicked on it and the appearance of it wouldn't seperate into 3 lines on top of each other like it needed to.
